# Red Squirrel Job Sheet — Free Windows EXE via GitHub Actions
**No paid services. No code signing.**

## Steps
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `RedSquirrelJobSheet`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files** and drag-drop the *contents* of this folder (not the folder itself). Commit.
3. Go to the **Actions** tab → the workflow "Build Windows EXE (Free)" runs automatically.
4. When it finishes (green check), open the run → download artifact **RedSquirrelJobSheet-Windows.zip**.
5. Inside is **Red Squirrel Job Sheet Setup.exe** — double-click to install (unsigned, so SmartScreen may show "More info → Run anyway").

The installer/shortcut will use your embedded logo.
